# AllTheWorldsAStage
One of my bucket list items, a soliloquy in code.

It is written to compile on Windows using Visual Studio 17. It does run and provide meaningful output (on Windows using MessageBoxes).
However, the real intent is for the source code to be read starting from the main function and traced through as if you were the CPU
following the execution path.

Please enjoy,
